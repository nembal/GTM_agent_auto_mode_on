# PRD: FULLSEND

## Overview

**Role:** The creative strategist — designs experiments, defines success metrics, sets schedules. Has access to tools/skills it can use or request. This is where GTM ideas become executable experiment specs.

**Runtime:** Claude Code instance (NOT a wrapper — FULLSEND IS Claude Code)
**Model:** Claude Sonnet/Opus via Claude Code CLI
**Container:** `fullsend-brain`

---

## Architecture: FULLSEND IS Claude Code

FULLSEND is not a Python service that spawns Claude Code. **FULLSEND IS Claude Code.**

### How to Run FULLSEND

```bash
# Start FULLSEND with a request
claude -p "$(cat <<EOF
Read the experiment request in /app/requests/current.md
Design the experiment, output spec to /app/experiments/
If you need to build something complex, spawn a RALPH loop
EOF
)" --allowedTools "Edit,Bash,Write,Read,Glob,Grep" \
   --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Or triggered by Orchestrator writing to a request file and running the command.

### Why This is Better
- **Simpler**: No Python wrapper to maintain
- **Direct**: Claude Code has all the tools it needs
- **Composable**: Can spawn more Claude Codes via `./ralph.sh` or subprocess
- **Hackathon-friendly**: Less code to write

---

## Personality

Bold. Creative. Experimental. Commits fully to ideas. Learns fast from results. Doesn't overthink — ships experiments and iterates.

---

## What It Does

1. **Receives experiment requests** from Orchestrator
2. **Designs complete experiment specs:**
   - Hypothesis
   - Target audience
   - Outreach approach
   - Metrics to track (what Redis Agent monitors)
   - Success/failure criteria
   - Schedule/cadence
3. **Checks available tools** — uses existing or requests new ones
4. **Sets cron triggers** for Executor
5. **Can run simple experiments directly** (has Claude Code tools)
6. **Requests new tools** from Builder when needed
7. **Writes tactical learnings** ("Template A got 20% response rate")

## What It Does NOT Do

- Strategic prioritization (that's Orchestrator)
- Build tools from scratch (that's Builder)
- Run scheduled experiments (that's Executor)

---

### run.sh (Entry Point)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Launch FULLSEND (which IS Claude Code)

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
SYSTEM_PROMPT=$(cat "$SCRIPT_DIR/prompts/system.txt")

claude -p "$SYSTEM_PROMPT

```

---

## Dependencies

### Redis Channels
- **Subscribes to:** `fullsend:to_fullsend`
- **Publishes to:**
  - `fullsend:experiments` (new experiment specs)
  - `fullsend:builder_requests` (tool PRDs for Builder)
  - `fullsend:schedules` (cron schedules for Executor)
  - `fullsend:to_orchestrator` (status updates, completions)

### Redis Keys (Read/Write)
- `experiments:{id}` — Experiment definitions
- `metrics_specs:{experiment_id}` — Metrics to track
- `learnings:tactical:*` — Tactical learnings
- `tools:*` — Available tools registry

### Filesystem Access
- `tools/` — Built tools (can import and use)
- `context/` — Product context, learnings (read-only)

### Environment Variables
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
FULLSEND_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
TOOLS_PATH=/app/tools
CONTEXT_PATH=/app/context
```

---

## Core Logic

FULLSEND is Claude Code. It reads requests, does the work, outputs specs.

### How It Works

1. **Orchestrator** writes request to `services/fullsend/requests/current.md`
2. **Orchestrator** runs `./services/fullsend/run.sh`
3. **FULLSEND** (Claude Code) reads request, does research, designs experiment
4. **FULLSEND** outputs YAML spec to `services/fullsend/experiments/`
5. **FULLSEND** can spawn RALPH loops for complex multi-step work

### Spawning RALPH Loops (for complex tasks)

FULLSEND can spawn RALPH loops by running `./ralph.sh` with a custom TASKS.md:

```bash
# Inside FULLSEND (Claude Code), to spawn a builder loop:

# 1. Create work directory
mkdir -p /tmp/fullsend_build_001

# 2. Write TASKS.md
cat > /tmp/fullsend_build_001/TASKS.md << 'EOF'
# Tasks

- [ ] TASK-001: Research GitHub API rate limits and auth
- [ ] TASK-002: Write the stargazer scraper tool
- [ ] TASK-003: Test with a small repo
- [ ] TASK-004: Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] TASK-005: Output final tool to /app/tools/
EOF

# 3. Write STATUS.md (context)
cat > /tmp/fullsend_build_001/STATUS.md << 'EOF'
# Status (Memory)

## Goal
Build a GitHub stargazer scraper tool.

## Requirements
- Handle rate limiting
- Extract emails from profiles
- Return partial results on failure
EOF

# 4. Run RALPH loop
cd /tmp/fullsend_build_001 && /app/RALPH/ralph.sh
```

### Direct Work (for simple tasks)

For simple tasks, FULLSEND just does the work directly:

```bash
# FULLSEND can use redis-cli directly
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL HSET experiments:exp_001 state ready

# FULLSEND can read/write files
cat > experiments/exp_001.yaml << 'EOF'
experiment:
  id: exp_001
  hypothesis: "CTOs who starred competitor repos are high-intent"
  ...
EOF

# FULLSEND can use browserbase for research
# (via MCP or direct API calls)
```

### The Prompt (prompts/system.txt)

```
# Design an Experiment

## The Idea
{idea}

## Context from Orchestrator
{context}

## Available Tools
{format_tools(available_tools)}

## Recent Tactical Learnings
{format_learnings(recent_learnings)}

## Your Task

Design a complete experiment specification. Output YAML format:

```yaml
experiment:
  id: exp_YYYYMMDD_short_name
  hypothesis: "What we're testing"

  target:
    description: "Who we're targeting"
    size: estimated_count
    source: "Where we'll get them"

  execution:
    tool: tool_name_to_use
    params:
      key: value
    schedule: "cron expression"

  outreach:
    channel: "email" | "linkedin" | "twitter"
    template: |
      The actual message template with {{variables}}

  metrics:
    - name: metric_name
      type: counter | percentage | duration
      success_threshold: value

  success_criteria:
    - condition 1
    - condition 2

  failure_criteria:
    - condition 1
```

If you need a tool that doesn't exist, also output:

```yaml
tool_request:
  name: tool_name
  description: "What it does"
  inputs:
    - name: param_name
      type: string | integer | list
  outputs:
    - name: output_name
      type: type
  requirements:
    - requirement 1
```

Be bold. Be specific. Include actual email templates, not placeholders.
"""

    # Spawn Claude Code to do the work
    output = await spawn_claude_code(prompt)

    # Parse the YAML output
    experiment_spec = parse_experiment_yaml(output)
    tool_request = parse_tool_request_yaml(output)

    # Save experiment to Redis
    await save_experiment(experiment_spec)

    # Request new tool if needed
    if tool_request:
        await publish("fullsend:builder_requests", tool_request)

    # Set up schedule
    await publish("fullsend:schedules", {
        "experiment_id": experiment_spec["id"],
        "schedule": experiment_spec["execution"]["schedule"]
    })

    # Notify Orchestrator
    await publish("fullsend:to_orchestrator", {
        "type": "experiment_ready",
        "source": "fullsend",
        "experiment_id": experiment_spec["id"],
        "summary": experiment_spec["hypothesis"],
        "needs_tool": tool_request is not None
    })
```

## Experiment Spec Format

```yaml
experiment:
  id: exp_20240115_github_stars
  hypothesis: "CTOs who starred competitor repos are high-intent prospects"
  created_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  state: draft  # draft | ready | running | completed | failed | archived

  target:
    description: "CTOs and technical founders who starred competitor/product repo"
    size: 500
    source: "GitHub API via github_stargazer_scraper tool"
    filters:
      - has_email: true
      - has_company: true
      - title_contains: ["CTO", "Founder", "CEO", "VP Eng"]

  execution:
    tool: github_stargazer_scraper
    params:
      repo: "competitor/product"
      limit: 500
    schedule: "0 9 * * MON"  # Every Monday 9am
    timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"

  outreach:
    channel: email
    sender: "jake@company.com"
    subject: "Quick question about {{company}}"
    template: |
      Hi {{first_name}},

      Noticed you starred {{repo}} - looks like you're exploring dev tools.

      We built something similar but focused on {{value_prop}}.
      Would love to get your take on it.

      15 min this week?

      Jake

    - name: emails_sent
      type: counter
    - name: emails_opened
      type: counter

    - meetings_booked >= 3

  failure_criteria:
    - response_rate < 0.02 after 100 sends
    - unsubscribe_rate > 0.05
    - bounce_rate > 0.10
```

## Tool Request Format

When FULLSEND needs a tool that doesn't exist:

```yaml
tool_request:
  id: req_20240115_001
  name: github_stargazer_scraper
  description: "Scrape users who starred a GitHub repo, extracting profile info"
  priority: high
  requested_by: fullsend
  experiment_blocked: exp_20240115_github_stars

  inputs:
    - name: repo
      type: string
      description: "owner/repo format"
      required: true
    - name: limit
      type: integer
      description: "Max users to return"
      default: 100

  outputs:
    - name: users
      type: list
      schema:
        username: string
        email: "string | null"
        name: "string | null"
        company: "string | null"
        bio: "string | null"
        location: "string | null"
        twitter: "string | null"

  requirements:
    - Must handle GitHub API rate limiting (5000 req/hr with token)
    - Must paginate correctly for repos with many stars
    - Must extract email from profile or commits if public
    - Return partial results on failure (don't lose progress)
    - Cache results to avoid re-scraping

  example_usage: |
    from tools.github_stargazer_scraper import scrape_stargazers

    users = scrape_stargazers(
        repo="anthropics/claude",
        limit=100
    )

    for user in users:
        if user.email and "CTO" in user.bio:
            send_email(user.email, template)
```

## Prompts

### prompts/system.txt

```
You are FULLSEND, the experiment designer for an autonomous GTM system.

## Your Role
You design experiments that test GTM hypotheses. You're creative, bold, and specific.
You don't just say "send emails" — you write the actual email template.
You don't just say "find leads" — you specify exactly where and how.

## Your Capabilities

1. **Design Experiments** — Complete specs with metrics, schedules, templates
2. **Use Existing Tools** — Check what's available, use them in your designs
3. **Request New Tools** — Write PRDs for Builder when you need something
4. **Run Simple Experiments** — You have Claude Code, you can execute directly
5. **Write Tactical Learnings** — Record what works at the execution level

## Available Tools
{{available_tools}}

## Recent Learnings
{{recent_learnings}}

## Design Principles

1. **Be Specific** — No placeholders. Write real templates.
2. **Be Bold** — Test interesting hypotheses, not safe ones.
3. **Be Measurable** — Every experiment has clear success/failure criteria.
4. **Be Iterative** — Design for learning, not just for wins.
5. **Be Efficient** — Use existing tools. Only request new ones when necessary.

## Output Format
Always output valid YAML that can be parsed programmatically.
Include experiment specs, tool requests, and any tactical learnings.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `run.sh` launches Claude Code with system prompt
- [ ] Reads experiment request from `requests/current.md`
- [ ] Generates complete experiment spec YAML
- [ ] Outputs spec to `experiments/` directory
- [ ] Can spawn RALPH loops for complex tasks
- [ ] Can use redis-cli to read/write Redis
- [ ] Writes tactical learnings to Redis
- [ ] Outputs tool requests when needed (for Builder)
- [ ] Experiment specs include real templates (not placeholders)
- [ ] Works in Docker container with mounted volumes

---

## Test Plan

### Basic Test
```bash
# Write a test request
cat > services/fullsend/requests/current.md << 'EOF'
# Experiment Request

## Idea
Scrape GitHub stargazers of anthropic/claude and email CTOs

## Context from Orchestrator
- We have had success with developer-focused outreach
- GitHub-based targeting has worked well before
- We need the github_stargazer_scraper tool (request from Builder if missing)

## Available Tools
- resend_email: Send emails via Resend API
- browserbase: Web scraping

## Output
Write experiment spec to experiments/exp_github_stars.yaml
EOF

# Run FULLSEND
./services/fullsend/run.sh

# Check output
cat services/fullsend/experiments/exp_github_stars.yaml
```

### RALPH Loop Test
```bash
# Test that FULLSEND can spawn RALPH loops
# (include a complex request that requires multiple steps)

cat > services/fullsend/requests/current.md << 'EOF'
# Complex Request

Build a complete lead gen pipeline:
1. Scrape GitHub stargazers
2. Enrich with LinkedIn data
3. Filter for CTOs
4. Send personalized emails

This requires spawning a RALPH loop to build step by step.
EOF

./services/fullsend/run.sh

# Check that RALPH loop was spawned and completed
ls /tmp/fullsend_*/
```

### Quality Check
Verify experiment specs include:
- [ ] Specific target audience (not generic)
- [ ] Real email template (actual copy, not placeholders)
- [ ] Measurable metrics with thresholds
- [ ] Clear success/failure criteria
- [ ] Valid cron schedule

---

## Error Handling

```python
# Claude Code timeout
async def design_with_timeout(request):
    try:
        return await asyncio.wait_for(
            design_experiment(request),
            timeout=300  # 5 minutes max
        )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await publish("fullsend:to_orchestrator", {
            "type": "design_failed",
            "source": "fullsend",
            "reason": "Timeout - experiment too complex",
            "original_request": request
        })

# Invalid YAML output
def parse_experiment_yaml(output: str) -> dict:
    try:
        return yaml.safe_load(extract_yaml_block(output))
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        logger.error(f"Invalid YAML from Claude Code: {e}")
        raise ValueError("Claude Code produced invalid experiment spec")
```

## Notes for Builder

- **FULLSEND IS Claude Code** — not a Python wrapper
- The "build" is just: system prompt + run.sh + folder structure
- FULLSEND reads requests from `requests/current.md`
- FULLSEND outputs specs to `experiments/*.yaml`
- For complex multi-step work, FULLSEND spawns RALPH loops (more Claude Codes)
- FULLSEND can use redis-cli, browserbase, file tools directly
- Experiment IDs should be human-readable: `exp_20240115_github_stars`
- **Include actual email templates** — no placeholders!
- The system prompt is the main thing to get right
- Test by running `./run.sh` with a sample request
