              Hi {{first_name}},

              I saw you're hiring for a {{job_title}} at {{company}}.

              What if instead of hiring and onboarding for 6-8 weeks, you could deploy an AI agent that starts Monday?

              AgentForge builds custom AI agents for back-office work:
              → Same output as a human hire (processes invoices, extracts data, validates forms)
              → Fraction of the cost ($2K/month vs $45K+ salary + benefits)
              → Zero ramp time (live in 48 hours)
              → Scales instantly (need 3 more? Deploy 3 more)

              We've built agents for invoice processing, data entry, document review, and claims processing. Companies use us to either:
              1. Fill the role without hiring
              2. Free up their team for higher-value work

              Worth a 15-min call this week to see if this could work for {{company}}?

          Hi {{first_name}},

          Following up on my note about the {{job_title}} role.

          Quick question: Did you end up filling the position, or still interviewing candidates?

          If you're still looking, I'd love to show you how AgentForge could solve this faster (and cheaper) than a traditional hire.

          15 minutes this week?

          Best,
          Alex

          {{first_name}},

          Last note on this: If the {{job_title}} role is still open (or if you have other back-office positions), we can get you an AI agent running by Friday.

          Worth exploring?

          Alex

  expected_outcomes:
    optimistic: "15% reply rate (10+ replies), 5+ meetings booked. Hiring = highest intent signal we've tested."
    realistic: "10% reply rate (7 replies), 3 meetings booked. Validates hypothesis that active hiring = strong buying signal."
    pessimistic: "5% reply rate (same as CTO baseline). Hypothesis rejected — hiring signal doesn't translate to higher engagement."

  cost_estimate:
    browserbase_sessions: "$0.20/session × 100 companies = $20"
    resend_emails: "$0.001/email × 70 emails = $0.07"
    total: "$20.07 per run"
    cost_per_meeting: "$6.69 (if 3 meetings booked)"

  notes: |
    This experiment tests the core hypothesis: companies hiring = high intent.

    Key innovations:
    1. **Intent Signal** — Job posting = explicit pain + active budget
    2. **Job-Specific Personalization** — Subject line references exact role ("Re: Invoice Processor posting")
    3. **Speed-to-Value Messaging** — 48 hours vs 6-8 weeks hiring timeline
    4. **Cost Comparison** — $2K/month vs $45K+ salary
    5. **Meta Narrative** — "This email was sent by an AI agent" = product proof

    Why this should outperform CTO experiments (5% reply baseline):
    - CTOs get cold emails constantly. Ops leaders get fewer.
    - CTOs evaluate tech. Ops leaders solve immediate pain.
    - GitHub stars = passive interest. Job postings = active need.
    - "Replace your hire" is more urgent than "improve your workflow"

    If reply rate hits 10%+, this becomes our primary channel.
    If it hits 15%+, we scale to 500 companies/week.

    Next iterations if successful:
    - Test different automatable roles (which converts best?)
    - Test timing (contact them day 1 vs day 14 of posting?)
    - Test messaging variants (cost savings vs speed vs quality)
    - Add LinkedIn outreach as second touchpoint
    - Build job posting monitor (alert us when new roles posted)
