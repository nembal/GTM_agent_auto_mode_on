      Hey {{first_name}},

      Saw you starred {{repo_name}} {{days_ago}} days ago — we're solving a similar problem but specifically for GTM teams at Series A+ companies.

      Most eng teams at your stage hit a wall when sales wants "just one more integration" every week. We built Fullsend to run autonomous GTM experiments without pulling engineers off the roadmap.

      Built on the same stack you're already using (Next.js + Supabase patterns), but with agent loops that generate ideas, build their own tools, and learn from results.

      Worth 15 min to see if it clicks?

      Best,
      [Your Name]

      PS - If you're not the right person, mind pointing me to whoever owns your GTM tooling?

      Following up on my note about autonomous GTM experiments.

      Quick question: What's your current process when sales wants to test a new outbound channel (like cold email to {{repo_name}} stargazers)?

      Most CTOs tell us: "Sales writes a spec, eng builds it in 2 weeks, idea is stale by then."

      We eliminate that cycle entirely. Curious if you've found a better way?

  success_criteria:
    - "Reply rate >= 8% (matches or exceeds previous experiment)"
    - "At least 5 meetings booked (2.5% conversion)"
    - "Positive sentiment in 75%+ of replies"
    - "Zero spam complaints or LinkedIn callouts"

  failure_criteria:
    - "Reply rate < 5%"
    - "More than 2 spam complaints"
    - "Zero meetings booked after 2 weeks"
    - "Negative sentiment in >50% of replies"

  learning_goals:
    - "Does 'Re:' subject line still outperform direct subject?"
    - "Is 30-day recency better than 90-day for intent signal?"
    - "Do follow-ups increase meeting rate by >3x?"
    - "Which competitor repo context gets best response?"

  risk_mitigation:
    - "Test with 50 emails first, review replies before scaling"
    - "Use professional email domain with proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC"
    - "Honor unsubscribes immediately via redis_agent monitoring"
    - "Track spam complaints, auto-pause at threshold"

  notes: |
    Building on tactical learning from exp_20260201_cto_stargazer_email which tested
    similar hypothesis. This version adds:
    - Multi-repo targeting for broader funnel
    - Follow-up sequence to test persistence value
    - Tighter recency window (30d vs unclear in previous)
    - Explicit learning goals per repo source

    Tool available: github_stargazer_scraper
    Required: Email sender tool (request from Builder if not exists)
