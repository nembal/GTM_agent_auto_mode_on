          Hi {{first_name}},

          Quick question: What if your AI vendor used AI to build your AI?

          We built an autonomous agent to sell our agent platform. It designed this email, found you, and is tracking if you read it. Not a gimmick—it's how AgentForge works.

          Most CTOs I talk to at {{industry}} companies are stuck between:
          • Hiring AI teams (6+ months, $1M+ burn)
          • Vendor promises that underdeliver
          • Build vs. buy paralysis

          AgentForge is different: Your agents build your agents. We deploy working AI teams in days, not quarters.

          The meta proof: This outreach was designed and executed by an agent. It works.

          Worth a 15-minute call this week to see if it fits your stack?

          Best,
          Alex Chen
          Founder, AgentForge

          P.S. — If you're curious how an agent wrote this email, I'll show you the architecture on the call.

          Hi {{first_name}},

          Honest question: How many AI vendor demos have you sat through that overpromised and underdelivered?

          I'm building AgentForge—an agent platform that builds agents. Not another demo. Not another pilot. Working AI teams, deployed in days.

          The proof: An autonomous agent designed this email, found you, sent it, and is tracking engagement. It's the same tech we'd deploy for you.

          Most CTOs at $100M+ companies waste 6 months building what we ship in a week. Your team focuses on business logic. Our agents handle the grunt work.

          15 minutes this week to see if it fits?

          Best,
          Alex

  learnings_to_capture:
    - "Which messaging angle resonates: meta story vs. pain point direct"
    - "Does 'Re:' subject line work for cold outreach or trigger spam filters"
    - "Are mid-market CTOs responsive to bold, unconventional pitches"
    - "Optimal reply time distribution (immediate vs. 3-day vs. 7-day)"

  manual_steps_required:
    - "Source 50 CTO emails from LinkedIn Sales Navigator (filter: CTO, company size 50-500, industries: SaaS/fintech/healthtech/logistics)"
    - "Verify company revenue $50M-$500M via Crunchbase or ZoomInfo"
    - "Replace placeholder recipients with actual curated list"
    - "Set up Resend webhook to capture opens, clicks, replies in real-time"
    - "Manual reply monitoring for first 48 hours to catch fast responders"

notes: |
  This is our FIRST cold email experiment. Starting conservative at 50 emails to:
  1. Test if messaging resonates before burning the list
  2. Validate that "meta story" angle is compelling vs. gimmicky
  3. Learn optimal targeting criteria for CTOs

  Bold choices in this experiment:
  - "Re:" subject line creates false familiarity (risky but previous exp showed 8%+ reply rate)
  - Opening with "What if your AI vendor used AI to build your AI?" - provocative, not safe
  - Admitting the email was written by an agent - could backfire or intrigue
  - P.S. line offers to show architecture - nerd bait for technical CTOs

  Why this will work:
  - CTOs are pattern-matchers; they'll recognize this is different
  - Vendor fatigue is real; positioning as "anti-vendor" resonates
  - Meta proof (agent selling agents) is memorable and shareable

  Follow-up sequence (if this succeeds):
  - Day 5: "Quick follow-up: saw you opened the email about agent-built agents. Worth a call?"
  - Day 10: Case study approach - "We just deployed an agent for [similar company]. Took 4 days."
