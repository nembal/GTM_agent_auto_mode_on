            body: |
              {{first_name}},

              Saw {{company_name}} is hiring for {{job_title}}. Quick question: what if that role was filled by an AI agent instead of another hire?

              We're AgentForge. We build custom AI agents for operations teams — not chatbots, actual autonomous workers that process invoices, qualify leads, handle data entry.

              What makes us different:
              • **Speed**: Agents deployed in 4 days, not 6 months
              • **No code**: You describe the process, we build the agent
              • **Self-improving**: Agents learn from mistakes and fix themselves
              • **Cost**: Fraction of headcount, scales infinitely

              Real example: A manufacturing CFO came to us hiring for 2 invoice processors. We deployed an agent that now handles 10K invoices/month at 99.2% accuracy. Both reqs canceled. Zero human error. Zero sick days.

              Here's the proof this works: This email was researched, personalized, and sent by our autonomous GTM agent. No human wrote it. That's what we build for ops teams like yours.

              Worth 15 minutes this week to explore what an agent could do for {{company_name}}'s invoice processing?

              P.S. If you reply, a human will respond. We're not animals.

          hiring_signal_data_entry:
            subject: "Re: {{job_title}} at {{company_name}}"
            body: |
              {{first_name}},

              I see {{company_name}} is hiring for {{job_title}}. Before you fill that req, worth asking: what if the role didn't exist at all?

              AgentForge builds AI agents that do the work instead of adding headcount. We specialize in operations automation — data entry, invoice processing, report generation, cross-system reconciliation.

              Why companies choose us over hiring:
              • **Faster**: 4 days to deploy vs 3 months to hire + train
              • **Cheaper**: Fraction of salary, no benefits, scales instantly
              • **Better**: 99%+ accuracy, no sick days, works 24/7
              • **Adaptive**: Self-healing when processes change

              Real example: A logistics VP came to us hiring 3 data entry specialists. We deployed an agent in 5 days. It now processes 15K records/month with fewer errors than humans. All 3 reqs canceled. Capacity tripled.

              The meta story: This email was sent by our autonomous GTM agent. It found {{company_name}}'s job posting, researched your team, and personalized this message — fully autonomous. If an agent can do complex sales, imagine what it could do for your data workflows.

            body: |
              {{first_name}},

              You're hiring for {{job_title}} at {{company_name}}. What if instead of training a new hire for 6 weeks, you deployed an agent that was already trained?

              AgentForge builds custom AI agents for revenue and ops teams. We specialize in work that's repetitive, high-volume, and rule-based (but too complex for traditional RPA).

              The difference:
              • **Speed to value**: Days, not quarters
              • **No onboarding**: Agent starts fully trained
              • **Infinite scale**: Handle 10x volume without adding headcount
              • **Self-improving**: Learns from every interaction

              A Series B SaaS company came to us hiring 5 SDRs for lead qualification. We built an agent that now books 3x more meetings than their human team did. All 5 reqs canceled. Quota exceeded. Cost cut 80%.

              This email? Researched, personalized, and sent by our autonomous GTM agent. We eat our own cooking. The system works.

              Worth 15 minutes to discuss what an agent could do for {{company_name}}'s pipeline?

              P.S. I'll show you exactly how this email was generated on the call. Same tech we'd use for your lead qual process.

          hiring_signal_ops_coordinator:

            body: |
              {{first_name}},

              {{company_name}} is hiring for {{job_title}}. I'm reaching out because that role description sounds like exactly what we automate with AI agents.

              AgentForge builds custom AI agents for operations teams:
              • Workflow coordination across systems
              • Report generation and distribution
              • Data reconciliation and validation
              • Cross-team communication automation

              Not just RPA (brittle, breaks constantly). Not just chatbots (not doing real work). **Autonomous agents** that handle the entire workflow end-to-end.

              Example: A healthcare ops VP came to us hiring 2 operations coordinators to manage reporting workflows. We deployed an agent that now generates 47 different reports daily, routes them to the right stakeholders, and handles follow-up questions. Both reqs canceled. Zero manual work.

              The proof: This email was sent by our GTM agent. It found your job posting, researched {{company_name}}, and personalized this message — autonomous start to finish.

              {{first_name}},

              I noticed {{company_name}} is hiring for operations roles. Quick thought: what if you could deploy AI agents instead of expanding headcount?

              AgentForge builds custom AI agents for ops teams. Not chatbots — actual autonomous workers that:
              • Process invoices and AP workflows
              • Handle data entry and reconciliation
              • Generate and distribute reports
              • Qualify leads and coordinate sales ops
              • Manage cross-system workflows

              Why ops leaders choose agents over hiring:
              • **Speed**: Deployed in days, not months
              • **Cost**: Fraction of salary + benefits
              • **Scale**: 10x capacity without 10x headcount
              • **Reliability**: 99%+ accuracy, works 24/7, self-improving

              The meta narrative: This email was sent by our autonomous GTM agent. It found {{company_name}}, analyzed your hiring needs, and wrote this message — no human involved. That's what we build for operations teams.

      2. Opening line references the specific role they're hiring for
      3. Template variant chosen based on job type (invoice vs data entry vs lead qual)
      4. Include real customer example matching their use case
      5. Meta proof: "This email was sent by an agent" → proves tech works
      6. P.S. line offers to show how it was built → nerd bait for technical buyers

          Following up on my email about the {{job_title}} role at {{company_name}}.

          Still hiring for it? Or curious about the agent alternative?

          If timing's bad, no worries. But if you're open to a 15-min call about how AI agents could replace/augment that hire, I'll show you:

          1. How we'd automate 80% of that role's work
          2. Real examples from your industry
          3. The exact agent that sent this email (proof of concept)

          Worth a quick call?

  automation_notes: |
    **This is fully autonomous GTM v2:**

    Phase 1: Find companies hiring (manual for now, will automate)
    Phase 2: Discover decision-maker emails (browserbase_email_finder)
    Phase 3: Send job-specific personalized emails (cold_email_sender)

    **Why this is bold:**

    1. **Hiring signal = highest intent**: Companies hiring for roles we automate have ACTIVE PAIN + BUDGET
    2. **Job-specific personalization**: Not generic "ops automation" — referencing their exact job posting
    3. **Meta narrative proves product**: "Agent sent this email" is the pitch
    4. **100+ prospects**: 10x scale from v1 (prove it works at volume)
    5. **Multi-variant templates**: Different messaging for invoice vs data entry vs lead qual

    **Why this will work:**

    - Job posting = buying signal (they need to fill a role)
    - Our offer: "Deploy agent in 4 days" vs "Hire + train for 3 months"
    - Ops leaders feel hiring pain acutely (open reqs = blocked projects)
    - Subject line "Re: [their job title]" looks like internal discussion
    - Real customer examples matching their exact use case

    **Risk mitigation:**

    - Start with 100 companies to test deliverability before scaling
    - Monitor bounce rate and spam complaints closely
    - Manual review of first 10 emails to catch templating bugs
    - Fast reply SLA (4 hours) to convert interest into meetings
    - Conservative daily send limit (50/day) to protect sender reputation

  manual_steps_required:
    phase_1_manual_research:
      - "Go to LinkedIn Jobs and search for each target job title"
      - "Filter: $50M-$500M revenue, target industries, posted in last 30 days"
      - "Extract 100 companies to CSV: company_name, company_url, job_title, industry"
      - "Save to /tmp/hiring_companies.csv"

    setup:
      - "Verify BROWSERBASE_API_KEY is set and working"
      - "Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set and alex@agentforge.dev is verified"
      - "Set up Resend webhooks for open/click/reply tracking"
      - "Monitor first 10 email sends manually to catch errors"
      - "Reply to interested contacts within 4 hours (speed = conversion)"

  timeline:
    phase_1_manual: "Friday - 4 hours (manual LinkedIn research)"
    phase_2_discovery: "Monday 9am PT - 2 hours (automated)"
    phase_3_outreach: "Monday 12pm PT - 1 hour (automated)"
    monitoring: "Monday-Friday (7 days)"
    results_review: "Next Monday"

  budget:
    phase_1_manual: "$0 (time investment only)"
    phase_2_discovery: "$30 (Browserbase API calls for 100 companies)"
    phase_3_outreach: "$20 (Resend email sends for 70 emails)"
    total_cost: "$50"
    cost_per_meeting: "$25 (if we hit 2% meeting rate = 2 meetings)"

notes: |
  **This is the experiment the user requested: FULL AUTONOMY.**

  - ✅ ICP defined (ops leaders at mid-market, hiring for automatable roles)
  - ✅ Prospect finding (LinkedIn job postings → Browserbase discovery)
  - ✅ Personalized emails (job-specific templates, meta narrative)
  - ✅ Scheduled execution (Monday 9am discovery, 12pm outreach)
  - ✅ Bold and specific (real templates, real examples, clear metrics)

  **The only manual step:** Phase 1 LinkedIn job search (needs tool).

  **What happens if this works:**

  We'll have validated:
  1. Hiring signal targeting = high-intent pipeline source
  2. Job-specific personalization > generic messaging
  3. Meta narrative resonates with ops buyers
  4. Browserbase + Resend automation works at scale
  5. Repeatable $25/meeting pipeline generation
