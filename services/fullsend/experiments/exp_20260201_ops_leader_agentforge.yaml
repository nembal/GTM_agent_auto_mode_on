            Hi {{first_name}},

            Your competitors are hiring more ops teams. You could be deploying AI agents instead.

            I'm reaching out because {{company}} operates in {{industry}} where operational efficiency = competitive advantage. Most ops leaders I talk to waste 6 months evaluating AI vendors. We ship working agents in days, not quarters.

            AgentForge is different: AI agents that build AI agents. It's meta, but it works. Proof? An autonomous agent found your email, wrote this message, and sent it. Same tech we'd deploy for your operations.

            Three angles we're testing with ops leaders:

            1. **Speed to value**: Deploy in days vs. 6-month pilot purgatory
            2. **Meta proof**: This email was designed and sent by an agent—it's the product
            3. **Operational AI**: Not chatbots. Process automation, data pipelines, workflow orchestration

            {{company}} likely has:
            - Manual data entry workflows eating hours/day
            - Reporting dashboards that take a week to generate
            - Cross-system reconciliation that's still Excel hell

            We'd build the agents to fix them. Days, not months.

            Worth a 15-minute call this week?

            Best,
            Alex Chen
            Founder, AgentForge
            alex@agentforge.dev

            P.S. — If you're curious how an agent found your contact info and wrote this email, I'll show you the architecture on the call. It's the same stack we'd use for your ops workflows.

      - Role-specific value prop (ops leaders care about efficiency, CFOs care about ROI/speed)
      - Meta narrative: "This email was sent by an agent" proves the product works

  success_criteria:
    - "Email discovery rate >= 70% (find contacts at 7 out of 10 companies)"
    - "Send at least 20 emails from discovered contacts"
    - "Reply rate >= 8% within 7 days (match CTO experiment benchmark)"
    - "At least 1-2 positive replies (meetings, interest signals)"
    - "Bounce rate < 8% (acceptable for automated discovery)"
    - "Automation works end-to-end without manual intervention"

  failure_criteria:
    - "Email discovery rate < 50% (tool not finding contacts)"
    - "Bounce rate > 15% (scraper returning bad emails)"
    - "Reply rate < 3% after 7 days"
    - "Zero positive replies after 10 days"

  iteration_plan:
    if_success: |
      - Scale to 100+ companies across more verticals
      - A/B test subject lines: 'Re: AI workforce' vs 'Re: your competitors are hiring'
      - Add follow-up sequence at day 5: "Saw you opened the email about AgentForge. Worth a quick call?"
      - Build learnings database: which industries respond best, which pain points resonate

    if_failure: |
      - If discovery fails: improve browserbase_email_finder (try LinkedIn Company pages, Crunchbase)
      - If bounce rate high: add email validation step before sending
      - If reply rate low: test different messaging angles (less meta, more ROI-focused)
      - If zero replies: pivot to warm intro strategy or LinkedIn outreach

  learnings_to_capture:
    - "Does automated email discovery → send workflow perform at scale?"
    - "Which industries respond best: manufacturing vs logistics vs healthcare vs financial services?"
    - "Does the meta narrative ('agent sent this') intrigue or annoy ops leaders?"
    - "Are ops-focused pain points (data entry, reporting, reconciliation) compelling hooks?"
    - "Optimal company size: $50M-$200M vs $200M-$500M revenue?"
    - "Does 'Re: AI workforce deployment' subject line get opens?"

  automation_notes: |
    This is our FIRST fully automated prospecting experiment:
    1. browserbase_email_finder scrapes company websites for VP Ops/CFO/COO contacts
    2. cold_email_sender sends personalized emails to discovered contacts
    3. No manual list building required

    If this works, we've validated:
    - End-to-end automation (find → personalize → send)
    - Meta narrative (agent-sent email proves the product)
    - New ICP (ops leaders, not just CTOs)
    - New verticals (manufacturing, logistics, healthcare)

  manual_steps_required:
    - "Verify BROWSERBASE_API_KEY and RESEND_API_KEY are set"
    - "Ensure alex@agentforge.dev sender is verified in Resend"
    - "Monitor first 5 emails manually to catch any templating errors"
    - "Set up Resend webhook for reply tracking"
    - "Reply to interested contacts within 4 hours (speed = conversion)"

notes: |
  **Why this experiment is bold:**

  1. **Full automation**: No manual list building. We're trusting browserbase_email_finder to find the right people.

  2. **New ICP**: Ops leaders, not CTOs. Different pain points, different value prop.

  3. **Industry-specific**: Targeting ops-heavy industries where AI ROI is obvious.

  4. **Meta narrative doubles down**: "An agent found your email and wrote this" is the entire pitch.

  5. **Real company targets**: Not generic "mid-market companies" - actual named companies with URLs.

  **Why this will work:**

  - Ops leaders are drowning in manual processes. They FEEL the pain daily.
  - Manufacturing/logistics/healthcare = high operational overhead = clear ROI for automation
  - "Days vs months" resonates with ops leaders (they've been burned by slow vendors)
  - Subject line "Re: AI workforce deployment" sounds like internal discussion, not spam
  - P.S. line offers to show how it was built = nerd bait for technical ops leaders

  **Risk mitigation:**

  - Starting with 10 companies (30 emails max) to validate before scaling
  - Monitoring bounce rate closely (automated discovery = higher risk of bad emails)
  - Manual review of first 5 sends to catch templating bugs
  - Fast reply SLA (4 hours) to convert interest into meetings

  **If this succeeds, we'll have:**

  - A repeatable prospecting motion (find → send → track)
  - Validation of new ICP (ops leaders respond)
  - Proof that meta narrative works across audiences
  - Foundation for multi-channel expansion (LinkedIn, Product Hunt, GitHub)
