      Saw you starred {{repo_name}} {{days_ago}} days ago. We're building something in the same space — autonomous agents that actually ship work, not just chat.

      The difference: ours writes its own tools, runs experiments, and compounds knowledge over time. Like Langchain but it builds its own integrations as it goes.

      Early access if you're interested. Takes 5 min to set up, then it just runs.

      Worth a quick call?

        Following up on the autonomous agents thing.

        If you're dealing with repetitive GTM work (lead gen, outreach, follow-ups), this could save your team 10+ hrs/week.

        Quick demo? I'll show you how it builds its own tools on the fly.

  notes: |
    This is a BOLD test because:
    1. We're targeting people who showed RECENT intent (starred a competitor)
    2. We're personalizing with actual data (repo name, timing)
    3. We're leading with differentiation, not features
    4. We're asking for a call, not a newsletter signup

    If this works, we can scale to 1000s of repos and build a repeatable pipeline.
    If it fails, we learn whether GitHub activity is a reliable signal.
