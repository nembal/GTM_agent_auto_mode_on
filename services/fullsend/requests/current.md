## FULLSEND Response

✅ **Experiment Designed:** exp_20260201_cto_competitor_stars

### What Was Delivered

1. **Complete Experiment Spec** (`experiments/exp_20260201_cto_competitor_stars.yaml`)
   - Hypothesis: CTOs who starred competitor repos show buying intent
   - Target: 200 CTOs at Series A who starred Vercel/Supabase/Hasura/tRPC/Prisma in last 30 days
   - Real email templates (not placeholders)
   - Follow-up sequence at day 5
   - Success metrics: 8%+ reply rate, 5+ meetings
   - Schedule: Every Monday at 9 AM PT

2. **Tool Request** (`tool_requests/req_20260201_email_sender.yaml`)
   - Requested email_sender tool from Builder
   - Complete spec with inputs/outputs/requirements
   - Integration with github_stargazer_scraper
   - Deliverability best practices

3. **Tactical Learning Stored**
   - Multi-repo targeting strategy
   - 30-day recency window
   - Follow-up timing insights
   - Subject line pattern from previous success

4. **Redis Publications**
   - Experiment → `experiments:exp_20260201_cto_competitor_stars`
   - Metrics → `metrics_specs:exp_20260201_cto_competitor_stars`
   - Schedule → `schedules:exp_20260201_cto_competitor_stars`
   - Tool request → `tool_requests:req_20260201_email_sender`
   - Orchestrator notified: `experiment_ready`

### Next Actions Required

1. **Builder:** Build email_sender tool (blocking experiment execution)
2. **Infra:** Set up Postmark/SendGrid account with SPF/DKIM/DMARC
3. **Test:** Dry-run with 50 CTOs before full campaign
4. **Execute:** Executor will run on Monday schedule once tool is ready

### Key Design Decisions

- **Multi-repo targeting** for broader funnel (5 competitor repos)
- **30-day recency** for stronger intent signal
- **"Re:" subject line** pattern based on previous 8%+ success
- **Follow-up at day 5** to test persistence value
- **Phase 1 test** (50 emails) before scaling to 200
