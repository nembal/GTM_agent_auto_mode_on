        'Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT', 'joaomdmoura/crewAI')

    orchestrator_reasoning: 'The CTO stargazer experiment is a reasonable first hypothesis,
      but we''re blocked on execution - we only have ''test_hello_world'' as a tool.
      Before we can run any GitHub-based targeting experiments, we need the ability
      to scrape stargazer data. This is the foundational capability that enables this
      experiment and many future ones. Note: Product context is also undefined, which
      will affect email personalization quality, but we can build tools in parallel
      while that gets resolved.'
