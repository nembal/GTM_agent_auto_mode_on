prd:
  name: job_posting_finder
  purpose: Find mid-market companies actively hiring for roles that AgentForge can
    automate (invoice processing, data entry, lead qualification, customer support).
    These hiring signals indicate budget, pain, and urgency - making them high-intent
    prospects.
  inputs:
    role_keywords: List of job titles/keywords to search for (e.g., 'data entry clerk',
      'invoice processor', 'accounts payable specialist', 'lead qualifier', 'SDR')
    company_size: Target company size filter (employee count range, e.g., 200-2000
      for mid-market)
    max_results: Number of companies to return
    location: Optional geographic filter
  outputs:
    companies:
    - company_name: Name of the company
      company_domain: Company website domain
      employee_count: Estimated employee count
      industry: Company industry
      job_title: The specific role they're hiring for
      job_posting_url: Link to the job posting
      posting_date: When the job was posted
  implementation_notes: Could use LinkedIn Jobs API, Indeed API, or scrape job boards
    via Browserbase. Focus on recency (jobs posted in last 30 days) and signal quality.
    Mid-market = roughly 200-2000 employees.

    orchestrator_reasoning: Experiment is well-designed and strategically aligned,
      but requires a job posting finder tool to identify companies hiring for automatable
      roles. This is the core targeting mechanism that makes the campaign high-signal.
      Once built, we can run the full autonomous pipeline.
